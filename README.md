#DIT APP grangeMobile App

This project represents my submission for the final assignment for the Social Media Applications module in DIT's part-time Creative Digital Media program.

Please see [http://www.dit.ie/postgrad/programmes/dt539bmscincreativedigitalmediapart-time/].

##Setup

Clone the project onto a server that supports PHP and you'll need MySQL.

You'll need to create a database using the `db_dump\collegedata.sql` dump. Set up your user in `data_endpoint\db_config`.
